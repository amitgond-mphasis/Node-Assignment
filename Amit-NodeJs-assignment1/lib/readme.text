The student data file will provide demographic information and other characteristics for 
each student. This file should be provided to us each semester in order to track new students
 as they enter the institution. Students should only be included when they first enrolled in
  your institution under a distinct status; definitions are included in the table below. 
  This file should include one row per student ID and unique status.
